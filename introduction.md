# Big data & Data Science

## Definition

### Big data:
- is a blanket term for any collection of data sets so large or complex that it becomes difficult to process them using traditional data management trchniques.

### Data Sciece
- involves using methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract the knowledge it contains. 

## Characteristics of big data:
- Volume: How much data is there?
- Variety: How diverse are different types of data?
- Velocity: At what speed is new data generated?

## Facets of data
- The main categories of data are:
	- Structured
	- Unstructured
	- Natural language
	- Machine-generated
	- Graph-based
	- Audio, video, and images
	- Streaming

### Structured data:
- is data that depends on a data model and resides in a fixed filed within a record.

### Unstructured data:
- is data that isn't easy to fit into a data model because the content is context-specific or varying.

### Natural language:
- is a special type of unstructured data; 

### Machine-generated data:
is information that's automatically created by a computer, process, application, or other machine without human intervention.

### Graph-based or network data:
- "Graph" in this case points to mathematical graph theory. In graph theory, a graph is a mathematical structure to model pair-wise relationships between objects. Graph or network data is, in short, data that focuses on the relationship or adjacency of objects.

- The graph structures use nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store graphical data. Graph-based data is a nutural way to represent social networks, and its structure allows you to calculate specific metrics such as the influence of a person and shortest path between two people.

## The data science process:

### Consists of six steps
1. Setting the research goal
2. Retrieving data
3. Data preparation
4. Data exploraton
5. Data modeling or model building
6. Presentation and automation
