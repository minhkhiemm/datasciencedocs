# AI

## Definitions
- Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Machine learning is the process by which a computer can work more accurately as it collects and learns from the data it is given
- Although machine learning is mainly linked to the data-modeling step of the data science process.

## The modeling process
- The modeling phase consists of four steps:
	1. Feature engineering and model selection
	2. Training the model
	3. Model validation nd selectin
	4. Applying the trained model to unseen data
